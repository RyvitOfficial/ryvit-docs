# **How to Use**

## **Sign Up and Login**

- Developers must create an account.
- After logging in, they can **add a new contract**.

## **Contract Management**

- After adding a contract, accessible data keys are automatically retrieved.
- Users can manually add **data keys that cannot be fetched automatically**.
- The dashboard displays all data keys along with their **TTL status**.
- After registering a contract and its data keys, users must define **a List, or a Range, or a Function** for each data key that requires a value. These definitions serve as the basis for retrieving values and managing TTL effectively.
