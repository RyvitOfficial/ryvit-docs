## **Wallet & Payment System**

To facilitate automatic TTL extensions, an **internal wallet** is integrated:

- Users can **deposit XLM** into their wallet.
- **Ryvit** deducts **TTL extension fees** automatically when required.
- Users can withdraw their XLM balance at any time.
- If funds are insufficient:
  - The system sends **email alerts**.
  - TTL extensions are paused until the wallet is refilled.
  - Once funds are replenished, users can **manually restore expired contracts**.

For manual TTL extensions, a **detailed cost breakdown** is displayed before executing the operation. Payments can be made via:

- The **internal wallet**.
- **Direct connection to Soroban and Stellar wallets**.
