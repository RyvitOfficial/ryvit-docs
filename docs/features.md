# **Key Features**

## **Overview**

**Ryvit** transforms TTL management by:

âœ… **Automating** a previously complex and manual process.  
âœ… **Eliminating** the need for extensive coding.  
âœ… **Providing a professional and intuitive dashboard** for contract management.  
âœ… **Ensuring uninterrupted contract operation** by managing TTL effectively.  
âœ… **Reducing development overhead** for Stellar-based projects.

Other features include:

- **User registration and authentication** for blockchain developers
- **Adding contracts** and **automatically retrieving data keys**
- **Manually defining data keys** that cannot be automatically retrieved
- **TTL management** with three modes:
  1. **Email notification** when TTL reaches a defined threshold
  2. **Automatic extension** when TTL reaches a critical level
  3. **Select extension plan** (1 month, 3 months, 5 months)
- **Displaying all data keys** and their TTL status in the dashboard
- Performing **3 different operations** on data keys:
  - **List-Based Extension**
  - **Range-Based Extension**
  - **Function-Based Extension**
- **Payment for operations** via an internal wallet using XLM
- **Integration with Soroban and Stellar wallets** for payments
- **Email alerts** when wallet balance is low
- Ability to **restore contracts** after wallet balance is refilled
- **Future SDK and API** for direct contract integration with the TTL management system

### **Future Roadmap**

ðŸš€ **SDK and API development** for seamless contract integration.  
ðŸš€ **Enhanced user experience** with dashboard improvements.  
ðŸš€ **Advanced reporting and analytics** for contract TTL management.

With **Ryvit**, developers can focus on **building decentralized applications** without worrying about TTL maintenance. The **Stellar and Soroban ecosystem** becomes more accessible and developer-friendly, ensuring that contracts and data keys remain active and operational at all times.
